    ðŸ”§ Explanation
    int C::* is a pointer-to-member type.

    This expression is valid only if C is a class or union.

    So the first overload of test() is chosen if T is a class.

    If not, the substitution fails, and SFINAE makes the compiler fall back to the second version.

/*
    C::* â€” Pointer-to-member syntax
    C::* is the type of a pointer to a member (either a member variable or a member function) of class C.

    ?It is not a pointer to an object, but a pointer to a member within an object of type C.
---------
    struct MyClass {
    int x;
    };

    int MyClass::* ptr = &MyClass::x;  // pointer to member variable
    
    ?int MyClass::* is a pointer-to-member-of-MyClass that points to an int.
