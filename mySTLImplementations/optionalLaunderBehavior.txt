C++’s strict aliasing rules and object lifetime rules mean that just writing to raw memory and casting doesn’t always make the compiler recognize that a valid object lives there now.

Especially since C++17, the standard says:

If you use placement new on a buffer and access it through an old pointer, the behavior is undefined — unless you use std::launder.

So this is valid:

new (&buffer[0]) T{...};  // placement new
return *std::launder(reinterpret_cast<T*>(&buffer[0])); // OK ✅
But this is undefined:


new (&buffer[0]) T{...};
return *reinterpret_cast<T*>(&buffer[0]); // ❌ UB (undefined behavior)



static_cast<T&&>(expr) is legal if expr is of type T

But to do that, expr must be a real object of type T, not untyped memory (char buffer)

So you must go through reinterpret_cast<T*> and std::launder to legally and safely recover a T& before you can cast or move it

buffer[0] is a char&
static_cast<val_type&&>(char&) is invalid, there's no conversion from char& to val_type&&
