    The issue here is that sensor does not exist at the point where the function signature is being parsed.

    Problem: decltype(sensor.ipV4) tries to access sensor before it's declared.

    Solution: We use trailing return type syntax (auto ... -> decltype(...)) 
        because in this form, sensor is already declared when decltype(sensor.ipV4) is evaluated.


    decltype can only be used on existing variables

/*
Yes, exactly! If you write T::something, the compiler treats something as a dependent name because its meaning depends on T, which is a template parameter. Until the template is instantiated with a concrete type, the compiler does not know what T::something refers to.

What Does the Compiler Assume?
When the compiler sees T::something, it does not assume that:

T::something is a type â†’ You must explicitly say typename T::something.

S is unknown and S::ipv6 could be a type,static variable because of ipv6 depends on S its a dependent name and
you should use typename if its a type before using it
